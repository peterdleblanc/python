Introduction 

Multinational Geospatial Co-production Program (MGCP) is a multinational program to collect 
geospatial data worldwide, concentrating on areas where little data currently exists.  The MGCP data is 
collected in accordance with the criteria established in the MGCP Technical Reference Document (TRD) 
v4.2.  The MGCP is focused on data collection rather than portrayal of that data.  This standard is 
intended to provide portrayal requirements for MGCP data that can be used to produce a topographic 
map.  The portrayal rules that associate geospatial feature/attribute data instances with symbol 
specifications are based on the MGCP Feature Catalogue.  However, this standard also includes symbols 
for other features necessary for a topographic map that are derived from other data stores to include: 
administrative and geopolitical boundaries, and elevation data.   

The symbol specifications defined in this standard provide information about symbol graphics that 
vendors can implement in their own systems.   

This standard supersedes DGIWG 109, Portrayal Standard for MGCP Data, Edition 1.0, 17 November 
2009. 

This portrayal standard was prepared by the Multinational Geospatial Co-production Program - 
Technical Group (MGCP-TG) for those who intend to generate graphics from MGCP data. 

Recommendations for improving this standard should be sent to the Multinational Geospatial Co-
production Program - Technical Group (MGCP-TG) Chair for consideration. 

2  Scope 

The scope of this standard is to provide portrayal information and graphic symbols for features in the 
MGCP Feature Catalogue.  Selected attribute information on these features must also be portrayed.   
Portrayal information consists of symbol rules (which associate data to symbols) and symbol 
specifications (that define symbols).   

3  Conformance 

For symbols to conform to this standard they must meet the following criteria. 
 

  Symbols shall be “visually equivalent” to those symbol graphics in the standard.  Visually 

equivalent symbols are those that would be recognized by users as representing the same 
feature or information.  Symbols on actual maps shall conform to the delineation of the 
geospatial feature (area, line, point).  Shapes shown in this standard are representative 
examples only.  All labels shall be shown in accordance with this standard.  Conditional 
attribute labels will be filled in with the applicable information associated with the feature 
instance rather than the generic attribute labels shown in the standard. 

  Colors on printed maps shall be in accordance with Annex C – Color.

6  Feature Symbols Report (Annex A) 

6.1  Feature Information 

Each feature contained in the MGCP Portrayal Standard is identified by a yellow header that provides 
the name of the feature, the feature code, and which “data store” it is retrieved from – MGCP TRD4, 
Boundary, or Elevation (Figure 1).  There are also some non-features (deemed as “No Code”) that are 
included in the Portrayal Standard.  These no code features are included as placeholder symbols for use 
during product finishing as needed - Leader Line, Point of Change, River Flow Arrow, Road Route 
Marker, and Vertical Obstruction. 

Figure 1.  Feature header and Generalization Rules from Annex A 

 

6.2  Generalization Rules 

Generalization rules are used to adjust or reassign the display space delineation of a map feature for 
the purpose of achieving the desired cartographic result.  The generalization rule category designators 
are: 

GA – Generalization Aggregation rules blend or combine identical contiguous features. 

GC – Generalization Change rules indicate when a geometry will be altered or changed from 
one delineation to another.  These rules may also include dimensional conversion guidance to 
derive symbols for both a 1:50,000 and 1:100,000 scale topographic map (see Table 1).   

The generalization rules are listed by their specific rule number (GA-XXXX or GC-XXXX) directly below 
the feature header (Figure 1) and are defined in Annex J.

6.3.1  Symbol Name 

Each symbol in Annex A is identified by a blue header that provides the name of the feature, any 
attribution information used to further identify the symbol (if applicable), and the geometry of the 
symbol (area, line or point).  Examples of attribution information are “Intact”, “Not Intact”, 
“Obstruction” and “Non-obstruction”.   Note:  The term “Not intact” indicates the enumerant values of 
“Abandoned”, “Damaged”, “Destroyed”, “Dismantled” and “Under Construction” (those not deemed 
“Fully Functional”). 

6.3.2  Symbol Graphic 

 

Each symbol contains a “Symbol Graphic”.  The graphic is intended to give a general representation of 
the symbol’s appearance in order to aid in understanding the drawing instructions in the symbol 
parameters.  Many of the graphics are shown in an enlarged size compared to what would appear on a 
topographic map.  This enlargement was made in order to make the components of the symbol graphic 
more visible. 

6.3.3  Symbol Placement Instructions 

 

The symbol placement instructions provide basic information on how the symbol is to be placed in 
relation to its geometry. 

6.3.4  Symbol Type 

  

A symbol can be classified as either complex, compound or simple.   Complex and compound symbols 
are composed of more than one symbol component, while simple symbols are composed of only one 
symbol component.  Complex symbols are made-up of symbol components with different geometries 
(e.g. Built-up Area with an area-fill and perimeter line component).  Compound symbols are made-up of 
symbol components with the same geometry (e.g. Wood / evergreen with two area-fill components). 

6.3.5  Repeating Point and Interval 

 

This section (if applicable) provides detailed specifications for symbols that have a point component(s) 
that repeats at certain intervals along a line.  Those symbols that contain 2 different repeating point 
components will be referenced with a “Repeating Point and Interval 2” note. 

6.3.6  Note 

 

The Note section (if applicable) provides instruction on how the symbol is to be constructed as a group 
of components.  It may also contain other miscellaneous symbol information as needed.  

6.4  Symbol Component  

For each symbol component, the following information is provided (see Figure 2): 

  Component Reference # – A unique identifier for each component in the Portrayal Standard.

  Component Type – Identifies whether the component is an area, line, or point.  The types may 

be further detailed as Area-Fill, Line-Styled, Point-Simple, etc.  Elements of these component 
types are provided in subsequent paragraphs. 

  Color Token(s) – A name describing the color(s) to apply to the symbol component. 
  Description – A textual description of the component. 
  Parameters – The specifications for the symbol component.  Specific information is dependent 

on what type of symbol component is involved. 
 
6.4.1  Symbol component parameters 

 

The Parameters section provides the basic specifications needed to construct the component.  A “Note” 
may be included to provide additional instruction and/or how the component is placed in relation to its 
geometry.  The following standard parameters are used to specify the various elements or instructions 
for the symbol component.   

 

6.4.2  Point – Simple 

The Point – Simple component is defined by the following parameters: 

  Diameter 
 

Length 
Lineweight 

 
  Note 

 

6.4.3  Point – Shape  
 

The Point – Shape component is defined by parameters listed in Annex H, which also contains detailed 
drawing instructions. 

6.4.4  Line – Simple 

 

The Line – Simple component is defined by the following parameters: 

Lineweight 

 
  Screen Angle 
  Screen Percent 
  Note 

 
6.4.5  Line – Styled

  Note 

 
6.4.8  Order of colors and “painters model” 

 
Many symbols are constructed by combining several different symbol components.  Where different 
colored components are overprinted to obtain the desired effect, a “painter’s model” may be used to 
specify the symbol.  In the painter’s model, the component specified first will be overwritten by 
components that follow.  For example: Road /intact /all-weather hard surface/narrow median (see 
Figure 2), is specified by a thick black line, overprinted with a less thick dark brown line, followed by 
another thin black line, which ultimately produces the black “cased” portion of the road symbol.  The 
painter’s model in this standard is intended only to describe the symbol.  A different implementation 
may be required for actual map production.  In lithographic printing, for example, the thick black line 
would obscure anything else printed on top of it. 

6.5  Symbol Rules  

 

The Symbol Rules section provides the symbol rule information for the preceding symbol description.  
Symbol rules are rules that indicate the condition in which the symbol is selected.  They associate an 
instance of geospatial data with a particular symbol.  Attributes and enumerants included in the Criteria 
field are based on the DGIWG Feature Data Dictionary (DFDD) and appear in both text and code (Figure 
3).

6.5.1  Criteria for symbol portrayal 

The Criteria column indicates what specific attribute conditions are required for that particular symbol.  
A special criterion of “ALL” has been created, which indicates that all instances of the feature/geometry 
will receive the same symbol (Figure 4).

6.5.2  Features with more than one possible symbol 

When a feature has more than one possible symbol (e.g. Wood), more than one symbol rule will exist 
for that feature.  A symbol instance should match one and only one criterion (Figure 5).

6.5.3  Symbol rule information 

 

The symbol rule information is presented and defined as follows: 
 

  Reference # – Static unique identifier associated with the symbol rule.  Used to link the entry to 

entries in other Annexes. 

  Description – Textual description of the symbol rule (matches the Symbol Name). 
  Criteria – Indicates what specific attribute conditions are required for that particular symbol. 

 

6.5.4  Symbol rule syntax 

 
The syntax utilized in the symbol rule criteria is based on the Structured Query Language (SQL) and 
thereby is easily interpreted by implementation software applications.  Attribute names and 
enumerants are indicated by text and their corresponding codes. 

Operators are generally defined as follows:  

is equal 
is not equal 
greater than 
less than 
greater than or equal 
less than or equal 

=  
<>

6.6  Label Rules  

Labeling can be used to identify or assist in identification of the meaning of symbols, and also may 
supply additional information about the feature being portrayed.  Labeling requirements for symbols 
are identified in the Label Rules section for each symbol (Figure 6).  If the Label Rules section is not 
present, then a label is not required for that symbol. 

 

Figure 6.  Label Rules from Annex A 

6.6.1  Label Placement rules  

 

Label Placement (LP) rules are used to provide the initial baseline type placement for the rendered 
portrayal of an applicable symbol.  LP rules are listed by their specific rule number (LP-XXXX) for each 
applicable symbol in Annex A and are defined in Annex J.  See also Figure 8-Figure 11 below. 

6.6.2  Label Rule information 

 

The label rule information is presented and defined as follows: 

  Reference # – Static unique identifier associated with the label rule. 
  Description – Textual description of the label placement rule. 
  Criteria – Criteria to further refine the label placement.  This is in addition to the symbol rule. 
 

Label String – The content of the label, which can be fixed text, variable label portraying 
attribute, varying label derived from attribute, or a combination of these.  Each label is listed in 
sequence. 

  Characteristics – A type style code for each label in the label string in sequence.  This is followed 

by an explanation of the code.  A complete list of text characteristic codes is included in Annex 
D.

6.6.3  Types of labels 
 

Labels can be of the following types: 

  Fixed label – the symbol has a label, and the content of the label is fixed, for example, the label 

“Falls” on a Waterfall, or “Rest area” on a Roadside Rest Area. 

  Variable label portraying attribute – the content of the label changes, depending on attribute 

information being portrayed.  An example would be showing the [Product] label on an 
Extraction Mine, such as “Coal”, “Diamond”, “Gold”, “Lead”, etc.  Another example would be to 
show the [Name] of a feature as a label, for example, “Olympic Stadium”, or “Central Park”. 
  Variable label derived from attribute – the content of a label changes based on the attribute 

information, but the text of the label is not the attribute value.  An example would be a 
Fairgrounds with [NAM] = Unknown [0] being labeled simply as “Fairgrounds”. 

  Combination – a series of labels of the various types listed above. 

 
6.6.4  Modification of label strings based on attribution 

 
Note that in some cases, the label string may have to be modified depending on whether attribute 
information is portrayed.  For example, if a label string is made up of a variable or attribute based 
element and a static element, then it wouldn’t make sense to have the label “Unknown” or “Other” for 
the variable portion.  In these cases, the variable portion should be omitted rather than place the label 
containing an attribute based portion such as “Unknown” on the symbol.  When concatenating multiple 
static or dynamic label string elements into a single label string, each static or dynamic label string 
element is separated from the next element by a single space. 

6.6.5  Attribute enumerants not intended for labelling 

 
Attribute values that are not intended to be labeled include: 

  Unknown [0] 
  Other [999] 
  Not Applicable [998] 

 
If an attribute is Unknown [0] or has not been collected, the label is also not shown.  Examples of these 
types of attributes are Height Above Surface Level [HGT], Railway Gauge [GAW], Track or Lane Count 
[LTN], or Name [NAM]. 

6.6.6  Text [TXT] attribute 

 
Whenever the Other [999] enumerant for any feature attribute is selected, the Text [TXT] attribute for 
that feature should be populated.  Since the text entered for the [TXT] attribute can refer to the Other 
[999] enumerant of one or more attributes, no rule can determine if or how the text should be used.  
However, the text should be considered for potential feature labelling where applicable.

6.6.7  Text Characteristics  

 
The Text Characteristics table in Annex D contains information specific to the text characters.  This 
information contains color, size, case, and style parameters. 

6.6.7.1  Text Characteristic parameters 

 
The parameters for text characteristics are specified as follows: 

  Text Characteristic # - Reference to link the characteristics to the Label Rule information in 

Annex A. 

  Color Token – Color Token for the label string. 
  Font Style – Indication of Condensed, Light Condensed, or Regular. 
  Style – Indication of Bold or Italics. 
  Font Size -- Point (PT) size of the label string. 
  Case – Indication of capitalization.  Valid values are Upper case, Lower case, and Mixed case. 

 

 

6.6.7.2  Substitution of type size 

When space prohibits the use of a prescribed type size, a more appropriate size may be selected by the 
cartographer. 

6.6.7.3  Capitalization of label information 

 
Capitalization of label information on a symbol follows the general structure below: 

  The first letter is capitalized, for example, “Falls”. 
  For multiple words in a descriptive label, the first letter of the first word is capitalized, for 

example, “Chemical processing facility” or “Water pumping station”. 

  For proper names, the first letter in each word is capitalized, for example, “Yellowstone 

National Park”. 

 

6.6.7.4  Additional named features 
 

Topographic maps may contain names that are not necessarily extracted and/or symbolized as distinct 
feature entities. Examples of named “features” included in this category are: dispersed and scattered 
villages, farmsteads, suburban areas, mountains, mountain ranges, mesas, ridges, valleys, plains, 
canyons, peaks, hills, capes, points, peninsulas, inlets, etc.  Refer to Annex D for the recommended text 
characteristics of these additional named features (or similar features as appropriate). 

6.7  Symbol Samples 

The MGCP Portrayal Standard also provides “Symbol Samples” at the 1:50,000 map scale.  The first

6.7.1  Baseline Label Placement samples 
 

The symbol samples shown in Annex A also provide an initial baseline label placement (using LP rules) 
for the rendered portrayal of an applicable symbol (Figure 8-Figure 11).  Variation from this default 
placement may be required (via the use of subsequent product finishing rules) in order to resolve 
overprints and otherwise achieve the desired map readability.

6.8  Color 

A particular symbol may be a single color, or composed of multiple colors.  Labels are generally 
specified in one color.  
 

6.8.1  Methodologies for defining colors  

 
Colors can be specified using several methodologies:

  U.S. Department of Defense Standard Printing Color Catalog for Mapping, Charting, Geodetic 

Data and Related Products, referred to as “SPC”, is a methodology used in the U.S DoD to 
specify “spot” colors, which are unique mixtures of inks. 

  Pantone colors – Pantone colors are commonly used in the printing industry and are based on 

specific mixes of inks.  They are sometimes referred to as “spot” colors.  Each pantone color has 
an identifier assigned to it. 

  CMYK – Identifies the percentage of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (key) that is used to 

generate a specific color in process lithographic printing.  Process printing allows a wide variety 
of colors to be produced from these three primary colors and the black. 

 

6.8.2  Color tokens  

 
The Color Token definitions utilized for this standard are provided in Annex C.  This Annex provides a 
mapping from a specific color token to Pantone color names, to SPC ink colors, and to CMYK values.  
This mapping allows considerable flexibility in specifying equivalent colors in a variety of 
methodologies. 

Color tokens are used to specify generic names of colors for symbol components.  Color tokens can be 
replaced with different tokens if maps require different viewing conditions.  For example, different 
viewing conditions may be required for red-light readable, or red and blue/green-light readable. 

The use of a Color Token methodology provides for the greatest degree of flexibility at implementation 
to provide for an easy adaptation to various color needs.  It further allows for colors to be defined by 
the software applications as necessary to fulfill product requirements. 

Colors in Annex A and Annex D are specified for each symbol component by Color Token.  Annex C 
provides a listing of Pantone colors, SPC ink colors, and CMYK values that are applicable to the MGCP 
50K product.  The color token values used in this Standard can be mapped to this table to determine 
the CMYK values. 

6.8.3  Specification of colors in digital exchange files  

 
When exchanging digital files of finished products in Portable Document Format (PDF), it is important to 
note that specifying colors using the spot color channels in the PDF allows for much greater flexibility in 
the lithographic printing of the map.  If colors are specified only in CMYK, then four-color process 
printing is the only printing option available and red-light or red and blue/green-light readability cannot 
be absolutely assured. 

6.9  Type Fonts 

The TrueType Zurich font has been selected as the most appropriate font to represent the label 
information for the MGCP 50K product.  The following criteria were considered in selecting the font: 

  Format should be TrueType 
  Must be compatible with the Windows environment

  Must be similar to Swiss742 fonts specified in the MIL-STD-2402 and MIL-STD-2410 (e.g. 

compatible with the colors, sizes, styles) 
  Cost of the purchase of commercial fonts 
  All the diacritic marks must be supported 
  Extendable (must be possible to add new characters) 

 

6.9.1  Use of commercial type fonts  
 

The analysis concluded that the standard should not be too rigid regarding the use of one or another 
font. Nevertheless, for avoiding problems with the diacritical marks, the best choice is to use 
commercial fonts of recognized brand. These have Unicode codification and, in general, support all the 
current idiomatic characters. 

Secondly, the analysis included not only TrueType but also OpenType because to choose one font in 
particular would lead to extra cost depending on the national mapping work flow. Therefore, the 
standard should be as flexible as possible. 

6.9.2  Use of OpenType font  
 

OpenType will likely become the standard in the near future, given that OpenType has greater 
capabilities in complex writings (languages), extendable and advanced typography (kerning, and so on). 
However, some national mapping work flows are not yet fully compatible with the OpenType fonts.  An 
example of this is what happens with the PDF/X standard. The fonts used in the document must be 
embedded in it, including the metric and the codification’s data. Under the 1.6 version, the OpenType 
fonts are not accepted by the PDF format. 

6.9.3  Compatible equivalent type fonts  

 

The Swiss742 font is one of the “sans serif” style types. The first step was to look for any commercial 
font available similar to the Swiss742 being, at least, TrueType specification. The digital format of the 
font was not available so the MIL-STD-2410 in PDF version was utilized for comparison. The main 
brands like Bitstream/Corel, Monotype and Linotype were taken into account. Even though the 
criterion of the MIL-STD-2410 was to choose a single font, it was determined that the output for paper 
maps is better if a set of diverse fonts is used. These are TrueType fonts and they produce a good 
balance of functionality and aesthetics. 

Nevertheless, on the basis of these, a set of compatible or equivalent fonts can be established, and the 
producers may use them at will. Conversion tables must be as flexible and extendable as possible.  
Table 2, Font Mapping, provides a mapping from the Swiss742 to Zurich and Univers TrueType fonts.

6.10 Masking 

Table 2.  Font Mapping 

In this Portrayal Standard, there are a number of point components or symbols that have "open" or 
white areas.  It is intended that underlying symbology (such as vegetation) would not show through any 
of these white openings, but rather the component would mask out underlying symbols, not allowing it 
to fill any of the open or white portions of the symbol.  For example, the open or white portion of the 
Tower symbol would mask the underlying Built-up Area tint, not allowing it to fill any open portion of 
the Tower symbol.   

The following is a complete listing of Component Reference numbers from Annex A containing an open 
or white area as part of the symbol.

Annex B – Feature Symbol Quick Reference Guide  

This annex provides an abbreviated listing of each feature symbol from Annex A. Symbol graphics in this 
Annex are examples only and may not show every instance of potential labeling. Representative labels 
are shown only for those symbols which always require labeling. Some symbols may require varying 
descriptive labels based on attribution (i.e. "Gas" or "Oil" for the Product [PPO] attribute on Well/non-
water), and/or proper names when available.  See Annex A for specific symbol and label rules.

Annex C – Color 

This Annex presents the mapping from a specific color token to Pantone color names, the SPC ink codes, 
and CMYK values.  The colors presented in each row of the table are approximately equivalent. This 
mapping allows considerable flexibility in identifying equivalent colors in a variety of methodologies. The 
color token name provides a link to Annex A and Annex C. 

Color tokens can be replaced with different tokens if maps require different viewing conditions.  This 
annex provides both the standard red-light readable and alternative red and blue/green-light readable 
color tokens where applicable. 

The Pantone and SPC colors are normative/required because they provide the best consistency for 
lithographic printing.  CMYK colors are provided as an alternative and are informative.  CMYK values in 
the color tables may be altered as necessary in order to best match the intended Pantone/SPC colors.  
NOTE:  red-light and red and blue/green-light readability cannot be absolutely assured when using CMYK 
process printing/plotting.

Annex H – Detailed Drawing Instructions  

This Annex contains detailed drawing instructions for the point shape components used in Annex A for 
symbols that could not be easily explained in a small set of parameters. The pictures shown in this 
Annex are not to scale, but have been enlarged to make it easier to view the drawing.  Unless otherwise 
noted in the Symbol Placement Instructions in Annex A, all symbol elements provided in Annex H are 
shown in their default orientation of 0 degrees (i.e. to the south neatline). 

In Annex H, there are a number of point components or symbols that have "open" or white areas.    It is 
intended that underlying symbology (such as vegetation) would not show through any of these white 
openings, but rather the component would mask out underlying symbols, not allowing it to fill any of the 
open or white portions of the symbol.  For example, the open or white portion of the Tower symbol 
would mask the underlying Built-up Area tint, not allowing it to fill any open portion of the Tower 
symbol.  See section 6.10 for Component Reference numbers in Annex H that contain an open or white 
area as part of the symbol.

Annex I – Patterns  

Samples of the patterns referenced in Annex A are provided in this annex. The Component Reference 
number provides the link in Annex A to where the pattern is included as part of a symbol.  Since most of 
the area patterns were inherited from the MIL-STD-2410, a historical reference has been made in the 
document for each of the patterns in Annex I to identify its original pattern number in the MIL-STD-
2410.  For example, the field “MIL-STD-2410 Reference: AP-95” means that the area pattern was 
originally AP-95 in the MILSTD-2410 document dated 31 January 1995.  The reader may wish to 
reference the listed area pattern in the MIL-STD-2410 dated 31 January 1995, for additional information. 

All pattern samples provided in Annex I are shown in their default orientation (0 degrees).  Some area 
patterns will require rotation to correctly portray the depicted features with ground truth (for example 
Sand Dunes).

Annex J – Generalization and Label Placement Rules 

The generalization and label rules associated with individual feature symbols in Annex A are listed here 
by rule number, grouped by its 2-letter rule category designator and then sequentially within that group.  
Rules are listed once, though a particular rule may be associated with multiple feature symbols. 

Generalization rules may modify the geospatial data being input into the portrayal process to achieve 
the desired result. 

GA – Generalization Aggregation rules blend or combine identical contiguous features. 

GC – Generalization Change rules indicate when a geometry will be altered or changed from one 
delineation to another. 

Label rules indicate how labels are placed with respect to their related geometry and/or symbol. 

LP - Label Placement rules indicate the initial baseline placement of labels used as a part of a 
symbol, prior to finishing activities.

Annex L – Feature Symbol Index 

The features symbolized in Annex A, Feature Symbols are listed here based on two different sort orders.  
The first index is sorted alphabetically by DFDD Feature Name/Alternate Name.  Included with this listing 
are alternate (or “former”) names by which the community may traditionally know the feature/symbol 
as.  The second index is sorted by Feature Code (DFDD-like Code).  

The page numbers in the Feature Symbol Index provide the location in Annex A where the given feature 
information begins.  If there is more than one symbol for the selected feature, the reader may have to 
scroll down through the document to locate the symbol which he/she is interested in reviewing.
